			<h4>Object of the Game</h4>
The object of the game is to match the movie character with the movie and collect 
all matching pairs before the shot clock expires.

<h4>The Rules</h4>
On each turn, the player will first turn one card over, then a second. If the two cards match, the player scores one point, the two cards are removed from the game. If they do not match, the cards are turned back over.

The game continues in this fashion until all the cards are played.
	<ul>
		<li>Turn over any two cards.</li>
		<li>Match the movie character with their movie</li>
		<li>If the two cards match, cards are removed from play.</li>
		<li>If they don't match, cards are turned back over.</li>
		<li>Remember what was on each card and where it was.</li>
		<li>Try and remember the cards and their locations</li>
		<li>The game is over when all the cards have been matched.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Winning the Game</h4>
Once all the cards have been played the player will be announced the winner.
